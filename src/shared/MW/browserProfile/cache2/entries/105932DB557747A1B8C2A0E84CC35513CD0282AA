Regulations are needed in the presence of informational frictions, externalities, weak competition, and social objectives.</p><p><strong>Informational frictions</strong> occur when information is not equally available or distributed. A situation where some market participants have access to information unavailable to others is called <em>information asymmetry</em>. Regulations are put in place in an attempt to ensure that no participant is treated unfairly or is at a disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Externalities</strong> are costs or benefits that affect a party that did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. For example, a polluter may not bear the full cost of their actions.</p><p>Weak competition can lead to fewer choices, higher prices, and lack of innovation. Antitrust regulations (discussed later) seek to mitigate this problem.</p><p>Social objectives are achieved via provision of public goods (e.g., roads and police protection). A public good is a resource that can be enjoyed by a person without making it unavailable to others. Since people share in the consumption of public goods but don't necessarily bear a cost that is proportionate to consumption, regulations are necessary to ensure an optimal level of production of such public goods. Regulatory obligations imposed on firms (e.g., telecommunications firms should serve rural markets) can also serve social objectives.</p><h3>LOS 8.b: Explain the purposes of regulating commerce and financial markets.</h3><p outputclass=\"CFAI_ref\">CFA<sup>Â®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 1, page 586</p><ol><li><p><strong>Regulating commerce.</strong> Government regulations provide an essential framework to facilitate business decision-making. Examples of regulations covering commerce include company laws, tax laws, contract laws, competition laws, labor laws, banking laws, bankruptcy laws, and dispute resolution systems.</p><p>Regulations may facilitate or hinder commerce. For example, protections of intellectual property facilitate long-term investments in research. Similarly, trade agreements promote commerce internationally. Lack of enforcement or generally poor protection of intellectual property rights globally remains a concern. With increasing use of big data by businesses, privacy and data protection rules are concerns that are best addressed by regulation.</p></li><li><strong>Regulating financial markets.</strong> Financial market regulations include regulation of securities markets and regulation of financial institutions. Regulation of financial markets is critical to prevent failures of the financial system and to maintain the integrity of markets. The objectives of securities regulations include three interrelated goals: protect investors, create confidence in the markets, and enhance capital formation.</li></ol><h3>Regulation of Security Markets</h3><p>Ensuring the fairness and integrity of capital markets and thereby protecting investors is a key role of financial market regulators. Several observations can be made about securities markets regulations:</p><ul><li>Disclosure requirements are a key element of security markets regulations. Disclosures provide transparency (i.e., reduce information asymmetry) in financial markets and hence promote investor confidence.</li><li>Many securities regulations are directed toward mitigating agency problems. In the financial markets, investors often work through intermediaries (agents) whose interests often diverge from the interests of investors. Regulations imposing fiduciary duties seek to mitigate such agency problems.</li><li>Regulations have historically focused on protecting small (retail) investors (hence the relatively lax regulatory coverage of hedge funds and private equity funds that are marketed only to qualified investors).</li></ul><h3>Regulation of Financial Institutions</h3><h4>Prudential Supervision</h4><p><strong>Prudential supervision</strong> refers to the monitoring and regulation of financial institutions to reduce system-wide risks and to protect investors. Prudential supervision is important because the failure of one financial institution can have a far-reaching impact and may result in a loss of confidence. Due to high mobility of capital across the developed world, shocks in one part of the system can affect the whole system, leading to a global contagion. Prudential supervision focuses on diversification of assets, an adequate capital base, and risk management activities of financial institutions.</p><p>The cost benefit analysis of financial market regulations should also include hidden costs. For example, FDIC insurance for banks may incentivize them with excessive risk-taking (a moral hazard problem).</p><h3>LOS 8.c: Describe anticompetitive behaviors targeted by antitrust laws globally and evaluate the antitrust risk associated with a given business strategy.</h3><p outputclass=\"CFAI_ref\">CFA<sup>Â®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 1, page 587</p><h3>Antitrust Regulation</h3><p>While regulations often hinder foreign competition (to protect domestic businesses), they seek to promote competition among domestic businesses. Antitrust laws work to promote domestic competition by monitoring and restricting activities that reduce or distort competition.</p><p>Regulators often block a merger that leads to an excessive concentration of market share. Anticompetitive behavior such as price collusion, discriminatory pricing, bundling, and exclusive dealing is often also prohibited. Internationally, companies need to evaluate their product and marketing strategies in the context of multiple (and varying) regulatory regimes. For example, a multinational company may be subject to U.S. antitrust laws as well as EU antitrust laws.</p><p>When evaluating an announced merger or acquisition, an analyst should consider the anticipated response by regulators as part of the analysis.</p><h3>LOS 8.d: Describe classifications of regulations and regulators.</h3><p outputclass=\"CFAI_ref\">CFA<sup>Â®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 1, page 588</p><p>Regulations have important implications on businesses and the overall economy. Regulations can be classified as <strong>statutes</strong> (laws made by legislative bodies), <strong>administrative regulations</strong> (rules issued by government agencies or other bodies authorized by the government), or <strong>judicial law</strong> (findings of the court).</p><h3>Regulators</h3><p>Regulators can be government agencies or <strong>independent regulators</strong>. Independent regulators are given recognition by government agencies and have power to make rules and enforce them. However, independent regulators are usually not funded by the government and hence are politically independent. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), an independent regulator, is a nonprofit corporation established by the U.S. Congress to oversee audits of public companies and is primarily funded by annual fees paid by public companies, brokers, and dealers.</p><p>Industry <strong>self-regulatory bodies (SRBs)</strong> are private organizations that represent as well as regulate their members. Members of SRBs have to adhere to its rules. SRBs may have inherent conflicts of interest. These conflicts of interest may reduce the effectiveness of SRBs, especially in the presence of a more formal and effective regulatory structure. SRBs nonetheless are attractive in that they increase the overall level of regulatory resources, utilize the industry professionals with the requisite expertise, and allow regulators to devote resources to other priorities.</p><p>SRBs that are recognized by the government and given enforcement powers are self-regulating organizations (SROs). SROs are also independently funded and, as such, are politically independent. SROs regulate the behavior of their members and often provide public goods in the form of standards. Because of their recognition by the government, SROs fall within the category of independent regulators.</p><p>Outside bodies are not regulators themselves, but their product is referenced by regulators. Examples of outside bodies include FASB and IASB.</p><h3>LOS 8.e: Describe uses of self-regulation in financial markets.</h3><p outputclass=\"CFAI_ref\">CFA<sup>Â®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 1, page 588</p><p>FINRA is an SRO recognized by the SEC in the United States. FINRA's primary objective is to protect investors by maintaining the fairness of the U.S. capital markets. FINRA has the authority to enforce security laws and regulations. Similar SRBs can be found globally.</p><p>However, the use of SROs in civil-law countries is not common; in such countries, formal government agencies fulfill the role of SROs. In these civil-law countries, nonindependent SRBs may support the regulatory framework via guidelines, codes of conduct, and continuing education.</p><p>In common-law countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, SROs have historically enjoyed recognition.</p><h3>LOS 8.f: Describe regulatory interdependencies and their effects.</h3><p outputclass=\"CFAI_ref\">CFA<sup>Â®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 1, page 592</p><h3>Regulatory Interdependencies</h3><p>Regulation does not always conflict with the interests of the regulated. The <strong>regulatory capture</strong> theory is based upon the assumption that, regardless of the original purpose behind its establishment, a regulatory body will, at some point in time, be influenced or even possibly controlled by the industry that is being regulated. The rationale behind the theory is that regulators often have experience in the industry, and this affects the regulators' ability to render impartial decisions. Regulatory capture is more likely to be a concern with SROs than with government agencies. For example, regulatory capture is often cited as a concern with the commercialization of financial exchanges.</p><p>Regulatory differences between jurisdictions can lead to <strong>regulatory competition</strong>, in which regulators compete to provide the most business-friendly regulatory environment. <strong>Regulatory arbitrage</strong> occurs when businesses shop for a country that allows a specific behavior rather than changing the behavior. Regulatory arbitrage also entails exploiting the difference between the economic substance and interpretation of a regulation.</p><p>To avoid regulatory arbitrage, cooperation at a global level to achieve a cohesive regulatory framework is necessary. For example, regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions should be consistent globally; otherwise, polluters will simply relocate to less restrictive jurisdictions and the objectives of the regulations will not be achieved. Similarly, efforts to reduce the risk of a global financial crisis have been hampered by the lack of a cohesive global regulatory framework.</p><p>Even within a country, there may be a conflict between the objectives of different regulatory bodies, leading to an inconsistent overall regulatory framework. For example, regulations seeking higher fuel efficiency standards for automobiles may conflict with regulations from another agency seeking to make the automobiles safer.</p><h3>LOS 8.g: Describe tools of regulatory intervention in markets.</h3><p outputclass=\"CFAI_ref\">CFA<sup>Â®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 1, page 596</p><h3>Tools of Regulatory Intervention</h3><p>Three <strong>regulatory tools</strong> are available to regulators:</p><ol><li><strong>Price mechanisms.</strong> Price mechanisms such as taxes and subsidies can be used to further specific regulatory objectives; for example, sin taxes are often used to deter consumption of alcohol. Conversely, subsidies such as those on green energy can encourage specific economic behaviors. Per the Coase theorem, if an externality can be traded (and absent transaction costs), then the allocation of property rights will be efficient, and the resource allocation will not depend on the initial assignment of property rights. SROs and outside bodies are least likely to use price mechanisms.</li><li><strong>Restricting or requiring certain activities.</strong> Regulators may ban certain activities (e.g.,Â use of specific chemicals) or require that certain activities be performed (e.g.,Â filing of 10-K reports by publicly listed companies) to further their objectives.</li><li><strong>Provision of public goods or financing of private projects.</strong> Regulators may provide public goods (e.g., national defense) or fund private projects (e.g., small-business loans, student loans) depending on their political priorities and objectives.</li></ol><p>Newer regulatory tools continue to be developed as governments face new challenges. For example, following the financial crisis of 2008, to reduce systemic risk of financial contagion, the Financial Stability Board and the G20 introduced a new bail-in tool to deal with the failure of a financial institution. Under this framework, a clear set of rules was designed to ensure that the cost of failure is borne by the shareholders and creditors, not the taxpayers. Regulatory tools developed in response to past events may not necessarily work well under a different set of circumstances in the future; the jury is still out on the bail-in process.</p><p>Sometimes, a combination of regulatory tools may work better in conjunction. For example, in deterring consumption of junk foods, regulators may both tax the product category as well as require appropriate nutritional labeling for food.</p><p>The effectiveness of regulatory tools depends on the enforcement abilities (e.g.,Â sanctioning violators) of the regulators. Furthermore, the enforcement should have the desired effect of compliance with the regulations. For example, regulations seeking to protect investors in a public company may specify sanctions for violations. If the sanctions are borne by the company (and ultimately the shareholders) and not the individuals perpetrating the violations (i.e., management), then the sanctions end up hurting those that the regulations were intended to protect in the first place.</p><h3>LOS 8.h: Describe benefits and costs of regulation.</h3><p outputclass=\"CFAI_ref\">CFA<sup>Â®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 1, page 599</p><h3>Cost Benefit Analysis of Regulation</h3><p>A regulatory framework needs to be assessed in terms of the cost of the framework relative to the benefit it provides. U.S. federal regulatory agencies are required to conduct a cost benefit analysis prior to issuing a regulation.</p><p>The costs and benefits of regulations may be easy to view but difficult to quantify. The cost of a regulation is not limited to the implementation cost (i.e., the cost of operating a government agency to provide the monitoring and supervision); an analyst should also consider the cost of the regulation to the private sector.</p><p><strong>Regulatory burden</strong> (also known as government burden) refers to the cost of compliance for the regulated entity. Regulatory burden minus the private benefits of regulation is known as the <strong>net regulatory burden</strong>.</p><p>Regulators should be aware of unintended consequences of regulations. For example, regulations mandating an increase in automobile fuel efficiency standards may encourage consumers to drive more, reducing the effectiveness of the regulation. Regulatory burden is generally difficult to measure as it includes the indirect costs related to changes in economic behavior.</p><p>Regulatory costs are difficult to assess before a regulation is put in place. For this reason, many regulatory provisions include a sunset clause that requires regulators to revisit the cost benefit analysis based on actual outcomes before renewing the regulation.</p><h3>LOS 8.i: Describe the considerations when evaluating the effects of regulation on an industry.</h3><p outputclass=\"CFAI_ref\">CFA<sup>Â®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 1, page 602</p><p>Regulations can help or hinder a company or industry. Regulations may shrink the size of one industry (e.g., if it is heavily taxed) while increasing the size of another (e.g., an industry receiving subsidies). Analysts should review the impact of current and proposed regulations on an industry or company because regulations can have a large impact on valuation.</p><p>Regulations are not always costly for those that end up being regulated. If the regulator is captive, regulations may end up benefiting the regulated entities.</p><p>Regulations may introduce inefficiencies in the market. For example, past government bailouts of financial institutions have conveyed a message of future implicit guarantees. For this reason, the credit spreads on bonds issued by the financial sector may not fully reflect their risk.</p><p>Some regulations may be specifically applicable to certain sectors, while others may have broad implications affecting a number of sectors. Certain industries have more exposure to certain types of regulations. For example, environmental laws have greater implications for the mining, oil, and gas sectors than they do for the retail or health care sectors. Similarly, labor laws are most relevant to labor-intensive industries.</p><div id=\"VideoPlayerContainer\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Video Player region\" aria-live=\"polite\"><div
